            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11
              players each. The game takes place on a circular or oval-shaped
              field, with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch in the center. One
              team bats, trying to score runs, while the other team bowls and
              fields, trying to restrict the runs and dismiss the batsmen.
